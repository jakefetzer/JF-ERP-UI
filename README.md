#JF-ERP-UI
JF-ERP-UI is a Python-based user interface for an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system that I am developing for career advancement purposes. The app focuses on delivering an intuitive and efficient UI for managing various business processes, including inventory, sales, purchasing, and more.

Project Structure
The app is organized into several dashboards, each representing key ERP functionalities:
